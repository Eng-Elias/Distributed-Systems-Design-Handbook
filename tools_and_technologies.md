## 1. Databases

Choosing the right database is fundamental to system design. The choice primarily revolves around the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance (CAP Theorem), as well as the data model (structured vs. unstructured).

| Technology | Type | Best For | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PostgreSQL / MySQL** | SQL (Relational) | Structured data, ACID compliance, complex queries, and transactions. | Financial systems, e-commerce backends, or any application where data integrity and consistency are paramount. |
| **MongoDB** | NoSQL (Document) | Semi-structured or unstructured data, high development velocity, and horizontal scalability. | Content management systems, IoT applications, real-time analytics, and applications with rapidly evolving schemas. |
| **Cassandra** | NoSQL (Wide-column) | Write-heavy workloads, extreme fault tolerance, and linear scalability across multiple data centers. | Time-series data, large-scale messaging backends, and systems requiring high availability with no single point of failure. |
| **Amazon DynamoDB** | NoSQL (Key-value) | Applications requiring single-digit millisecond latency at any scale, with a flexible data model. | Serverless applications, gaming leaderboards, ad tech, and high-traffic web applications. |
| **Redis** | In-memory (Key-value) | Caching, real-time applications like leaderboards, session management, and message brokering. | When you need extremely fast (sub-millisecond) read/write operations and can fit the dataset in memory. |

## 2. Message Queues & Event Streaming

Message queues decouple services, enabling asynchronous communication, which improves scalability and resilience.

| Technology | Type | Best For | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RabbitMQ** | Message Broker | Complex routing logic, task queues, and ensuring message delivery with acknowledgments. | Sending notifications, processing background jobs (e.g., image resizing), and implementing the Saga pattern in microservices. |
| **Apache Kafka** | Event Streaming Platform | High-throughput, persistent, and ordered event streams for real-time data pipelines and analytics. | Log aggregation, real-time analytics, event sourcing, and feeding data into stream processing systems. |
| **Amazon SQS** | Managed Queue Service | Fully managed, highly scalable, and reliable message queuing for decoupling microservices and serverless applications. | When you want to offload the operational burden of managing a message broker in an AWS environment. |

## 3. Containerization & Orchestration

Containers provide a consistent environment for applications, while orchestration tools manage their lifecycle at scale.

| Technology | Type | Best For | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Docker** | Containerization | Packaging applications and their dependencies into a single, portable unit. | The standard for containerizing virtually any application, from monolithic backends to individual microservices. |
| **Kubernetes (K8s)** | Container Orchestration | Automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications at scale. | Managing complex microservices architectures, ensuring high availability, and enabling declarative infrastructure. |

## 4. Caching

Caching is a critical technique for reducing latency and decreasing the load on backend services and databases.

| Technology | Type | Best For | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Redis** | In-memory Data Store | Distributed caching, session storage, real-time leaderboards, and pub/sub messaging. | When you need a versatile, high-performance cache that can also serve as a primary database for certain use cases. |
| **Memcached** | In-memory Cache | Simple, high-performance, distributed memory object caching. | When you need a straightforward, volatile cache for small, static data like database query results or API responses. |
| **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** | Distributed Cache | Caching static assets (images, CSS, JS) and dynamic content at edge locations closer to users. | To reduce latency for global users, offload traffic from your origin servers, and improve website performance. Examples: Cloudflare, Amazon CloudFront. |

## 5. Monitoring & Observability

You can't manage what you can't measure. These tools provide insights into the health and performance of your system.

| Technology | Type | Best For | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prometheus** | Monitoring & Alerting | Collecting time-series data (metrics) from services through a pull-based model. | The de-facto standard for metrics-based monitoring in cloud-native environments, especially with Kubernetes. |
| **Grafana** | Visualization | Creating, exploring, and sharing dashboards to visualize metrics from various data sources. | To build dashboards for Prometheus, Elasticsearch, and other data sources to get a unified view of system health. |
| **Jaeger / Zipkin** | Distributed Tracing | Tracing requests as they travel through a distributed system to debug latency issues. | In a microservices architecture, to understand the flow of requests and pinpoint performance bottlenecks. |
| **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** | Log Management | Centralized logging, searching, and visualizing application and system logs. | To aggregate logs from all services into a single, searchable location for debugging and analysis. |

## 6. Service Mesh

A service mesh provides a dedicated infrastructure layer for making service-to-service communication safe, fast, and reliable.

| Technology | Type | Best For | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Istio / Linkerd** | Service Mesh | Managing traffic, enforcing security policies (mTLS), and gaining observability into microservices communication without changing application code. | In a large and complex microservices architecture to handle load balancing, service discovery, circuit breaking, and security uniformly. |

## 7. Load Balancers

Load balancers distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck. They are critical for scalability and high availability.

| Technology | Type | Best For | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nginx / HAProxy** | Software Load Balancer | High-performance, flexible traffic management at Layer 4 (TCP) and Layer 7 (HTTP). | When you need fine-grained control over load balancing algorithms, SSL termination, and HTTP routing. Can be self-hosted. |
| **AWS ELB / GCP Cloud Load Balancing** | Managed Load Balancer | Offloading the management and scaling of load balancing infrastructure to a cloud provider. | In a cloud environment to easily distribute traffic to VMs or containers. Offers seamless integration with other cloud services. |

## 8. Scheduled Jobs & Task Queues

These tools are used to execute background tasks, run periodic jobs, or manage long-running operations without blocking the main application thread.

| Technology | Type | Best For | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cron** | Time-based Job Scheduler | Running simple, recurring tasks on a single server at scheduled times. | System maintenance scripts, daily report generation, or any simple, time-based task. Not fault-tolerant. |
| **Kubernetes CronJob** | Distributed Job Scheduler | Running scheduled tasks reliably within a Kubernetes cluster. | For batch jobs, data backups, or any recurring task in a containerized environment where you need fault tolerance. |
| **Celery** | Distributed Task Queue | Managing a large number of asynchronous tasks with real-time processing and complex workflows. | Processing video uploads, sending emails, or any long-running task that needs to be executed outside the request-response cycle. |
| **AWS Lambda Functions / AWS Lambda Scheduled Events** | Serverless Functions and Scheduler | Running serverless functions on without managing any infrastructure. | For event-driven automation, data processing pipelines, and cron jobs in a serverless architecture. |

## 9. Storage Solutions

Choosing the right storage depends on the data type (files vs. objects), access patterns, and scalability requirements.

| Technology | Type | Best For | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Network File System (NFS) / Amazon EFS** | File Storage | Providing a shared file system that can be mounted by multiple servers simultaneously. | When legacy applications require a POSIX-compliant file system, or when multiple containers/VMs need to read and write to the same set of files. |
| **Amazon S3 / Google Cloud Storage / MinIO** | Object Storage | Storing and retrieving massive amounts of unstructured data (e.g., images, videos, logs, backups). | For data lakes, backup and restore, content delivery, and any application that needs highly durable, scalable, and cost-effective storage for large objects. |
