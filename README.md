# Distributed Systems Design Handbook

This repository documents my journey into the world of distributed systems design, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications. The notes, design patterns, and examples compiled here are the result of studying the resources listed in the references section. It's a personal collection intended to serve as a comprehensive handbook on the topic.

## Getting Started

This handbook is organized into the following sections:

- **[A System Design Strategy](./system_design_strategy.md)**: This document outlines a structured approach to tackling system design problems, from initial requirements gathering to detailed architectural decisions.

- **[Introduction to Distributed Systems](./Intro_To_Distributed_Systems/README.md)**: This section provides a deep dive into the fundamental concepts, patterns, and real-world examples of distributed systems.

- **[Common Tools and Technologies](./tools_and_technologies.md)**: A guide to the most common tools, technologies, and services used in distributed systems design.
