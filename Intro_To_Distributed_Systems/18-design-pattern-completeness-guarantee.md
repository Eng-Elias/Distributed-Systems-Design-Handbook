# Design Principle: Completeness Guarantee

Completeness Guarantee is a design principle closely related to Event Sourcing. It asserts that for a system to be truly robust, analyzable, and debuggable, it must capture **every event** that occurs, without exception.

## The Problem: Incomplete History

Often, there is a temptation to discard events that seem unimportant or are related to user errors. For example, if a user adds an item to their cart and then immediately removes it, it might seem like a meaningless event that can be ignored.

However, ignoring these events leads to an incomplete and misleading history of the system. If you only log "successful" or "important" events, you lose the context needed to understand the full picture. You won't be able to answer critical questions:

-   Why are users frequently adding and then removing this specific item?
-   Is there a bug in the UI that is causing accidental cancellations?
-   What is the true, complete journey of a user through the application?

## The Solution: Log Everything

The principle of Completeness Guarantee dictates that every event, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, must be recorded in the event log. This includes user errors, cancellations, and system-level events.

By ensuring a complete, unabridged log of everything that happens, you build a powerful asset. This complete history is the foundation for:

-   **Accurate Debugging:** You can perfectly reconstruct the exact sequence of events that led to a failure.
-   **Rich Analytics:** You gain a true understanding of user behavior and system performance.
-   **Total Audibility:** You have a complete, verifiable record of the system's history.
