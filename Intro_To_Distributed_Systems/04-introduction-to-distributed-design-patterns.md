# Introduction to Distributed Design Patterns

This section provides a high-level overview of design patterns in the context of distributed systems, differentiating them from traditional software design patterns and outlining the approach for studying them.

## Distributed Patterns vs. Object-Oriented Patterns

It's crucial to distinguish between the design patterns used in distributed systems and the traditional Object-Oriented (OO) patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Adapter).

-   **Object-Oriented Patterns:** Solve problems within the scope of a single application or codebase. They address challenges related to object creation, code structure, and behavior management.
-   **Distributed System Patterns:** Solve problems at a much higher level of abstraction. They provide solutions for challenges inherent to systems that run across multiple machines, such as coordination, data consistency, fault tolerance, and communication.

## Key Characteristics of Distributed Patterns

-   **They are Evolving:** Unlike the more established OO patterns, distributed system patterns are constantly developing as new technologies and challenges emerge.
-   **Implementation is Not Standardized:** A single pattern can be implemented in many different ways, and the specific implementation details can lead to vastly different system behaviors. The focus is on the concept, not a rigid implementation.

## Approach to Learning Patterns

For each pattern discussed in this course, the methodology will be as follows:

1.  **Define the Problem:** Clearly state the specific challenge the pattern aims to solve.
2.  **Discuss Solutions:** Explore various approaches and their inherent tradeoffs.
3.  **Build the Pattern:** Conceptually design the pattern, often using diagrams (e.g., with a tool like `app.diagrams.net`) to visualize the architecture.
