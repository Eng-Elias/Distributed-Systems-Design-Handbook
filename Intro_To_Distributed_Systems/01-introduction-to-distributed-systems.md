# Introduction to Distributed Systems

This document provides an overview of the "Introduction to Distributed Systems" course by Mohamed Mishref, outlining its purpose, target audience, and what to expect.

## About the Instructor

-   **Name:** Mohamed Mishref
-   **Experience:** A software developer with 18 years of experience working in multiple countries and for major tech companies like **Microsoft**, **Booking.com**, and **Amazon**.
-   **Background:** Has worked on large-scale systems serving hundreds of millions of users, including systems at Amazon that handle up to 500,000 requests per second.

## The Goal of This Course

-   **Problem:** The knowledge required to build distributed systems is vast and not available in any single, comprehensive resource. It's a science distributed across many different fields.
-   **Objective:** This course aims to provide a practical entry point into the world of distributed systems. It will bridge the gap by not only explaining the core concepts but also by walking through the design of real-world examples, such as:
    -   A hotel booking system (like Booking.com)
    -   A video uploading and streaming service (like Netflix)
-   **Uniqueness:** It is one of the first courses of its kind in Arabic to consolidate and apply these complex topics in a structured way.

## Who Is This Course For?

This course is **not for beginners**. To truly benefit from the material, you should meet the following prerequisite:

-   **At least one year of hands-on, practical software development experience.**

This includes experience like working at a company or releasing your own applications. A purely theoretical background is not sufficient, as the course's value comes from applying these concepts to solve real-world problems that are best understood through experience.
